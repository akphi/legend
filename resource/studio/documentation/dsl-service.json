                "value": "While `productionizing` a query, it is recommended that you should ensure that the service created will not break compilation. As such, we support `auto-configuration` for the workspace: this is our best effort to ensure the workspace has adequate and appropriate metadata (e.g. dependencies, models, mappings, runtimes, etc.) to make the service _just work_\n\nUsually, if the chosen project is the same as the query's project, no further configuration is needed, hence, it's safe to opt-out of `auto-configuration`; otherwise it's almost always safer to use `auto-configuration`"
